# scripts

Reusable execution helpers for the LiDAR compression and TSN workflow. Core entries include:
- `EBpapercopy2.py`: bundled compression algorithms used by the experiments.
- `run_subset_experiments.py`: minimal reproducible compression runner pointed at KITTI data.
- `tsn_generate_flows.py`: converts compression CSV output into TSN traffic definitions.
