# data

Container for LiDAR source material used by the experiments. Raw KITTI point clouds stay outside the repository, while this tree stores curated subsets or symlinks referenced by scripts.

Subdirectories:
- `KITTI_multi/`: small multi-scene samples for smoke tests.
- `KITTI_paper/`: trimmed datasets aligned with the paper figures.
